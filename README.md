Source Code for a Language Identifier.

This is an expansion off of a class project that I completed in Jan 2022.

Simple idea: give program a string of any language, and it outputs which language it thinks it is

Solution:
    So currently this has no ML/AI, only pure Statistics using unigram and bigram model to compute for the percentage.

Notes:
    The math and core of the project was not actually too hard as the math is relativly simple and as long as you don't make any mistakes it is universal. The hard part of this project was finding nice data for the training to take part on. I used the europarl corpus
